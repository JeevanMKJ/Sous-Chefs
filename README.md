## What does Sous Chef do?

In a nutshell, Sous Chef is the tool to find the recipe for both readers and follow-along learners.
For those who struggle finding the recipe that they want Sous Chef finds a variety of recipes for the food that a user wishes to cook. If a user can better follow video instructions an additional list of YouTube cook-alongs will be filtered out that match the search query.
